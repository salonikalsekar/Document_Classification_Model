# Document_Classification_Model


The Document Classification Model is based on the machine learning concepts and tools. 
 The document used for testing contains labels in the first column and the values in the second column. It is a .csv document. The test cases folder contains all the documents used for testing the model.

The first step carried out was studying the dataset provided which included document categories and it’s values. 

The dataset was then split into training and testing sets based on the dataset provided. 

The model was entirely built from scratch and in this process got very well versed with the Machine Learning tools and advanced concepts. 
Naïve Bayes algorithm and Normalization techniques were implemented. 

The entire model along with the UI based files was developed in a web framework Flask, a Python framework and hosted on AWS EC2 instance. 
The entire model results are displayed using Confusion Matrix. 
Although, I was just familiar with all the concepts and Cloud Computing services like AWS. This project helped me build a foundation in the Machine Learning domain and also gave me a great exposure to AWS and its various services.
